                <h3>What is Agile</h3>
                <p>Agile refers to a set of principles and practices for software development and project management that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and incremental progress.
                    The Agile methodology was developed in response to the limitations of traditional project management approaches, which often struggled to adapt to changing requirements and priorities.</p>

                <h3>State the principles of Agile</h3>
                <p><strong>Development:</strong>  Projects are broken down into small, manageable increments, called iterations or sprints, typically lasting from one to four weeks.</p>
                <p><strong>Adaptive Planning:</strong> Planning is done incrementally allowing for adjustments based on feedback and changing requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>Customer Collaboration:</strong> Customers, stakeholders, and development teams collaborate closely throughout the project to ensure that the product meets their needs.
                    Feedback is solicited early and often to guide development.</p>
                <p><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Teams reflect on their processes and performance regularly and make adjustments as needed to improve efficiency and quality.</p>
                <p><strong>Embracing Change:</strong> Agile processes are designed to be flexible and responsive to change.
                    Changes in requirements, priorities, or technology are expected and welcomed, with the goal of delivering the most valuable product possible.</p>

                <h3>What are the advantages of Agile</h3>
                <p>Agile methodologies offer a more adaptive, customer-centric, and collaborative approach to project management, leading to higher-quality products, increased customer satisfaction, and improved team effectiveness.</p>
                <p>Some of the key advantages of Agile:</p>
                <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Agile embraces teams to respond promptly to customer feedback and deliver a product that better meets their needs.</p>
                <p><strong>Early and Continuous Delivery:</strong> Agile promotes iterative development, with working product increments delivered frequently, typically every few weeks. </p>
                <p><strong>Customer Satisfaction:</strong> By involving customers and stakeholders throughout the development process, Agile ensures that their needs and priorities are considered at every stage. </p>
                <p><strong>Improved Quality:</strong> Agile methodologies emphasize frequent testing and feedback, which helps identify and address issues early in the development process.</p>
                <p><strong>Reduced Risk:</strong> Agile mitigates project risks by breaking work into smaller, manageable increments and delivering value iteratively. </p>
                <p><strong>Faster Time-to-Market:</strong> Agile's focus on delivering working software quickly enables organizations to bring products to market faster, gaining a competitive advantage and maximizing opportunities for revenue generation.</p>

                <p>The primary focus of this project was the Agile methodology due to its short timeline.
                    This necessitated addressing any issues with other teams concurrently with website development.
                    All adjustments were made with consideration for other teams, primarily involving creating ideas, presenting them to teams, making corrections based on their specifications, and iterating until consensus was reached among all parties involved.</p>
